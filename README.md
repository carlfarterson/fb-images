## Download your entire "Photos of You" album on Facebook to your computer.
### By: Carter Carlson

### Purpose
Everyone knows that Facebook's driving revenue is the sale of customer data
to 3rd parties.  How long will we give away free data about personal lives?
Instead of letting Facebook and other companies profit on your information, what
if that revenue could go directly to your pocket?  This program is a step towards
removing Facebook from your entire life.

### Description
Download your entire "Photos of You" album on Facebook to your computer into a folder
labeled `Photos-of-You`

#### Work in Progress.  Expect a completed version soon!
